## Quotes Application
> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```


## App Goals
The goal of the app is to learn Vue Components / passing data back and forth from parent to child and the opposite.

## JavaScript vs Vue JS Comparison
Check out my plain JS Budget App repo and look at the code(i used ES5) and see how 
many 
things I had to code to get the same functionality with list rendering. Now that I've used Vue It definetely saved 
time, headaches and mostly it gave me an other look over the things. Instead of thinking how I can code the app now 
I'm more focused on WHAT the app is gonna do!
