# Project Planning & Problems
Well sometimes we don't have to code all the time because there are things which need to be done first. At first 
place I didn't know how to do this app or even from where to start so I decided to express it on a white paper to analyze the problems,
how many components I have to make and the most important thing: WHAT causes all those problems!

## Writing down your mind on a paper is really helpful! It helps you organize your mind and focus on certain tasks.
